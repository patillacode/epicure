### What?

`epicure` is a collection of useful python methods and utils I tend to use in my personal projects.


### Why?

I like to keep my projects as lean as possible, and I don't like to add dependencies unless strictly necessary.
I usually end up writing the same little utils over and over again, so I decided to create a centralized place where I can keep them.
